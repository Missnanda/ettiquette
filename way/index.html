    <h1>The Miss Nanda Way</h1>
    <p style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 40px;">Welcome to a partnership crafted with care — where excellence meets respect, and growth is nurtured in every moment.</p>

    <h2>1. Time as a Gift</h2>
    <p>We start and end on time. A few minutes early sets the tone for focus and flow. Consistent attendance supports steady progress.</p>

    <h2>2. Space that Speaks</h2>
    <p>A clean, quiet corner—free of screens and noise—helps minds stay present and sharp. A cool, well-ventilated space is also highly recommended to maintain energy, comfort, and full focus throughout the session.</p>

    <h2>3. Tools in Hand, Mind Engaged</h2>
    <p>Books, iPads, and materials ready — on a desk that fits them all. A long, study desk (ideally 120 cm or more) allows everything to be within reach without crowding. When everything’s prepared, we can go further, faster.</p>

    <h2>4. Grace in Every Interaction</h2>
    <p>Politeness and kindness are expected from students and families alike. It’s how we keep learning gentle, joyful, and honest.</p>

    <h2>5. Speaking With Grace</h2>
    <p><em>Our language reflects our learning. We keep it clear, calm and kind.</em></p>
    <p>Messages to Miss Nanda should be written with courtesy. A warm, respectful greeting and clear message go a long way in creating a thoughtful learning culture.</p>

    <h2>6. Warm Hellos & Goodbyes</h2>
    <p>Welcoming Miss Nanda with a smile and walking her to the door after sessions are small gestures that reflect big character. They help children practice confidence, gratitude, and well-rounded manners.</p>

    <h2>7. Curiosity, Always</h2>
    <p>We encourage questions, wonder, and the courage to say, “I don’t know yet.”</p>

    <h2>8. Room to Learn</h2>
    <p>Sessions are sacred space. Interruptions are gently minimized — focus deserves to be protected.</p>

    <h2>9. Dress the Part</h2>
    <p>Learning is a state of mind. Fresh clothes and upright posture tell the brain: I’m ready.</p>

    <h2>10. Trust the Process</h2>
    <p>Growth takes time. We celebrate little breakthroughs while building big outcomes.</p>

    <h2>11. Mutual Respect, Mutual Reward</h2>
    <p>We show up with commitment. Families who bring warmth, gratitude, and honesty help us do our best work.</p>

    <h2>12. Nourishment with Intention</h2>
    <p>To maintain clarity and energy during sessions, Miss Nanda follows a clean, sugar-free lifestyle. While we deeply appreciate the kindness of offering refreshments, we gently ask that only wholesome, low-sugar options be considered—if any. Thank you for supporting this rhythm of teaching.</p>

    <h2>13. After the Session</h2>
    <p>We encourage families to allow students a quiet moment to reflect or rest — letting the learning settle and sink in, rather than rushing into the next activity.</p>

    <h2>14. Privacy & Boundaries</h2>
    <p>Please respect Miss Nanda’s privacy outside of sessions. Personal life and teaching space are kept separate — honoring this boundary ensures trust and professionalism.</p>

    <h2>15. Reschedules & Session Changes</h2>
    <p>We allow one reschedule per month with at least 24 hours’ notice. Missed sessions without notice cannot be made up. Thank you for understanding when life brings the unexpected.</p>

    <div class="etiquette-closing">
        <p>At Miss Nanda, etiquette is more than rules — it’s the quiet language of respect, care, and intention.
When we greet kindly, speak thoughtfully, and show up with purpose, we create more than just lessons.
We create a space where learning feels safe, graceful, and alive.</p>

<p>Here, every message matters. Every moment counts.
Let’s build something beautiful — one mindful interaction at a time.</p>
